Geode is a command line utility written in bash that displays more theme-based information. Similar to neofetch, or pfetch, but
has the intent of providing information that can be re-purposed by other users

Geode displays a number of things, which include: User terminal, shell, GTK theme, window manager, and memory usage. Above the graphic and info area, the host and user are also shown.

It functions by grabbing several variables, and then scanning for the output of a random number. Once the number is detected, a random graphic with a dedicated colorscheme will be printed.

Geode can be customized to whatever extent, as stated in the [MIT License](https://github.com/rampus-bit/geode/blob/main/LICENSE.md), but pull requests for new graphics will have to be reviewed before implementation.

*Note: Inspiration for this README.md was directly derived from [dylanaraps's neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch).*
